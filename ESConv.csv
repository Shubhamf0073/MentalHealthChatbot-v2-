"

Previous Experience,anger,problems with friends,I found out that my best friend kissed my boyfriend once i left a party the other day.,speaker,,4,"Exactly. I was planning a future with this man and he so recklessly threw it away.

There was definitely alcohol involved but that's no excuse
"

. I had to find out through a mutual friend who saw it."

All I can say though, is that in general when anything like this happens in life, I look at it like so,..   Whatever the issue is has already taken place, nothing I do at this point is going to change that, so really it's just up to me how to react to it.  I can either get all upset and be in a bad mood, or shrug it off and go on about my business.  Maybe that's just me though."

I guess all I'm saying is that I think I'd take a deep breath and cool down for a few days.   I mean you've known this woman for 20 years.   No question she was out of line, but that's a lot of friendship to throw away over some kissing.   "
Previous Experience,anger,problems with friends,I found out that my best friend kissed my boyfriend once i left a party the other day.,speaker,,3,"Well, it's not like she told me the truth or even apologized. So is that the kind of ""friend"" I want in my life?
"
Previous Experience,anger,problems with friends,I found out that my best friend kissed my boyfriend once i left a party the other day.,listener,Information,,"Well that's a fair point too.   I think you're right to judge her more harshly.   Let's take the kissing out of it.  Let's just find her guilty of a generic fuck up, she still ought to have the class to apologize.   Have you ever seen any sign of her being shitty like this before?  I mean is this out of character for her?"
Previous Experience,anger,problems with friends,I found out that my best friend kissed my boyfriend once i left a party the other day.,speaker,,,"It's out of character to some degree but she's always been pretty selfish
"

You're the only one who can make that call I'd think.   As for the boyfriend, I suppose if you want you can have some fun making him work his way out of the doghouse."

Previous Experience,depression,academic pressure,"While moods are commonly used to describe how an individual person feels at a given time, they also can be used to describe the atmosphere of groups of people, places, and eras or time periods.When describing how a group is feeling, a collective mood is often used.For example, if something unfair happens in the workplace and a group of employees lost their jobs, this group's mood can be described as frustrated and enraged.If a group of students gets to go on a fun field trip for the day instead of sitting in the classroom, the mood can be described as excited or elated.Descriptive writing can be used to set the mood of a place.When describing a place, you will want to add plenty of detail and use vivid words.For example, if writing about a beach use words such as salty sea air, gentle breeze, soft sand, lapping waves or warm sun rays.The mood set for this beach is calm and peaceful.When referring to a period of time or specific era, moods can be used to set the scene.Use wo",listener,Other,,"hello, you can share anything with me"
